#The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 
#On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg,killing 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew.

#This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. 
#One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. 

#Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, #and the upper-class conduct an analysis to learn the composition of the Titanic passengers and get a sense of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

#Using Titanic data, â€œTitanic.csv" describing the relevant information about the passengers, an analysis to learn the composition of the Titanic passengers and get a sense of what sorts of people were likely to survive is shown below
