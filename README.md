##[Project 1 Titanic Survival](https://github.com/toyosibamidele/Data-Science-Portfolio)

#The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 
#On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg,killing 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew.

#This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. 
#One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. 

#Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, #and the upper-class conduct an analysis to learn the composition of the Titanic passengers and get a sense of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

#Using Titanic data, “Titanic.csv" describing the relevant information about the passengers, an analysis to learn the composition of the Titanic passengers and get a sense of what sorts of people were likely to survive is shown below

##[Project 2 Challenger Space Shuttle Oring - Failure Prediction](https://github.com/toyosibamidele/Data-Science-Portfolio)

#The Challenger's service to America's space program ended in tragedy on Jan. 28, 1986. Just 73 seconds into mission STS 51-L, a booster failure caused an explosion that resulted in the loss of seven astronauts, as well as the vehicle.The cause of the disaster was traced to an O-ring, a circular gasket that sealed the right rocket booster. 

#The available clean data(temperature vs. Oring damage) for the launches prior to the Challenger are 23 data points (Dalal et al, 1989) ranging from 53 degree F to 81 deg F from 1981 to 1986.

#A simple logistic regression model utilizing python, for binary classification data (no damage vs damaged orings )is used to determine the probability of O-ring #erosion given the temperature over time data from launches prior to challenger from 53-degree F to 81 degrees F.
#Given the available data, it can be inferred that lower temperatures at launch show some evidence of erosion damage
